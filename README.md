# Address Book.com
This is a practice of a web application, and also the final project of the CS50, hope you enjoyed!

## What's Address Book.com

Address Book.com is an online address book where users can browse other users\â€™ information in a single main page, similar to a real-world address book. Key features include:   
**User Profile Management: Users can update their own information.**   
**Instant Search: Quickly query information without browsing page by page.**   
**Mailbox System: Receive messages from the admin directly on the platform.**   

### Management System
Admins have access to a management system with tools to:   
**Validate or Delete Users: Ensures only recognized users can access the address book.**   
**Send Messages: Communicate updates or important information to all or specific users.**   

This structure supports the privacy and security of an address book typically meant for a private group, like a club or fraternity.

### Try It Out

Experience the demo at [Address Book.com](https://ha3269570.pythonanywhere.com/login) using:   
Username: test01   
Password: test01   

This demo account showcases all functions and pages. After logging in, click the envelope symbol to read messages.

Feel free to fork this app to use or modify to your own.  

Note: This GitHub version differs from the demo. The test01 account with full access is exclusive to the demonstration, not in this repo version.   

### Auto-Register Script
For testing, use the auto_register_30.py script, which registers 30 sample users with basic information. Customize it as needed to suit your testing requirements.   

**Cuation: If deploying this app directly, change the default admin account password found in config.py immediately after setup.**
